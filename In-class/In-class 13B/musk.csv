ajtourville We learned our lesson with 465M DoE loan received in 20102011 onerous terms exceed value of money received Thats why we paid it back so early despite an early repayment penalty

PPathole Teslarati 13ericralph31 If we are able to make life selfsustaining on Mars we will have passed one of the greatest filters That then sets us up to become interstellarEarth is 45B years old but life is still not multiplanetary and it is extremely uncertain how much time is left to become so

Teslarati 13ericralph31 Earth has been and will be smashed super hard by meteors over time Not a question of if just when
Teslarati 13ericralph31 In 1992 comet ShoemakerLevy smashed a hole in Jupiter the size of Earth
Teslarati 13ericralph31 This will be really important one day Much is made of meteor impacts that destroyed most life on Earth but there were far more that merely destroyed a continent Comets not asteroids are the real wild card as were only able to track 4600 out of 1 trillion
About to launch asteroid defense test

czbinance CoinDesk binance egreechee Sounds good
flcnhvy WholeMarsBlog It can simulate anywhere but we need to focus on one region until FSD is out of beta then expand geographically to have betas in other countries Canada is not a lot different from US but different enough
WholeMarsBlog Highperformance code is in C using our own compiler to maximize frame rate We use Python with custom libraries for fast prototyping then convert to C for fast executionNew software is run against realworld video amp our world simulator to evaluate performance then QA
czbinance CoinDesk binance egreechee I dont use Binance tried at one point but signup was too many hoops to jump through so no inconvenience to me personally Just raising this issue on behalf of other Doge holders
WholeMarsBlog Our NNs didnt have any temporal amp spatial memory or surround video autolabeling back then everything was knitted together in C from single frames with manual labelingStill much to improve
